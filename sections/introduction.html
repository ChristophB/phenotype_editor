		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p class="text-justify">
			We consider a phenotype as an individual (as in
			<a href="http://www.onto-med.de/ontologies/gfo/">General Formal Ontology</a>, GFO), for
			example, the weight of a concrete person. Abstract instantiable entities, that are instantiated by phenotypes,
			are called phenotype classes (e.g., the abstract property ‘body length’ possess individual length values as
			instances.

			There are single and composite properties (traits), and correspondingly, single and composite phenotypes:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Single phenotype: a single property (e.g., age, weight, height)</li>
			<li>Composite phenotype: a composite property that consists of single properties (e.g.,
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index">BMI</a>,
				<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01709751">SOFA Score</a>) of an organism or its
				subsystem
			</li>
			<li>Boolean phenotype: a Boolean expression based on has_part relations</li>
			<li>Mathematical phenotype: a calculation rule (e.g., BMI = weight / height²)</li>
			<li>Furthermore, composite phenotype classes can associate certain conditions with specific predefined
				values (scores). Such phenotype classes we call score phenotype classes.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p class="text-justify">
			We distinguish between restricted and non-restricted phenotype classes, depending on whether their extensions
			(set of instances) are restricted to a certain range of individual phenotypes by defined conditions or all
			instances are allowed. For example:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Non-restricted: phenotype class “age”, which is instantiated by the ages of all living beings</li>
			<li>Restricted: phenotype class “young age”, which is instantiated by the ages of the young ones (age below
				some pleasant value).
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Architecture of the Core Ontology of Phenotypes</h2>
		<p class="text-justify">
			The Core Ontology of Phenotypes (COP) enables ontologists to model phenotype classes, so that phenotypes can be
			classified in phenotype classes based on instance data sets (e.g., of a patient). We used the class gfo:Property
			of the GFO to model properties or traits and we defined the class cop:Phenotype as subclass of gfo:Property
			(Figure 1 (a)). According to our definitions in Section 1, there are six types of phenotype classes:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>non-restricted (NSiP) and restricted (RSiP) single phenotype classes</li>
			<li>non-restricted (NScP) and restricted (RScP) score phenotype classes</li>
			<li>non-restricted (NMaP) and restricted (RMaP) mathematical phenotype classes</li>
		</ul>

		<p class="text-justify">
			Each subclass of cop:Single_Phenotype, cop:Score_Phenotype and cop:Mathematical_Phenotype is a phenotype class
			and is instantiated by phenotypes. Direct subclasses are non-restricted, while subclasses of non-restricted
			phenotype classes are restricted (e.g., age greater than or equal to 20 years: Age_ge_20).

		<p class="text-justify">
			Phenotype classes possess various common attributes (e.g., labels, descriptions and links to external concepts).
			Additional attributes vary depending on the phenotype class. NSiP classes define the datatype and a unit of
			measure, NMaP classes have a mathematical formula, RSiP and RMaP classes have restrictions and RScP classes have
			a Boolean expression and an optional score. Logical relations between phenotype classes as well as range
			restrictions are represented by anonymous equivalent classes or general class axioms based on property
			restrictions.
